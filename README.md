PIE sign in

Real-time event sign-in made easy.

As event attendees sign in on a laptop by filling in their name, email, etc. (without clicking a button), their data is sync-ed over to a separate admin view that an event host views on her iPad.  She can then place attendees into groups vi a drag-and-drop interface that immediately syncs every change to a real-time database (firebase)
